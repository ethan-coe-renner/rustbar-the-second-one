#+title: Rustbar: The Second One (RBTSO)

This is a reimplementation of my previous rustbar project.
While rustbar was intended for use in sway/i3, rbtso is intended for use with [[https://github.com/conformal/spectrwm][Spectrwm]].
However, RBTSO was written such that it may be easier to use with other bar programs.
